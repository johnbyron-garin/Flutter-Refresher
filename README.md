# Tara Kain

Tara Kain is a personal mobile application project that allows users to browse and explore Filipino food from the restaurant of the same name. The app provides an intuitive and engaging experience for food enthusiasts to discover dishes, customize their orders with add-ons, and simulate a complete food ordering and delivery process.

## Features

- **Browse Menu**: Explore a variety of Filipino cuisines with detailed information, including prices and available add-ons.
- **Add to Cart**: Select and add dishes to your cart for a seamless ordering experience.
- **Simulated Payment**: Experience a simulated credit card payment process with confirmation receipts.
- **Order Tracking**: Monitor your ongoing food delivery in real-time.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Switch between dark and light themes to suit your preference.

## Purpose

This project was developed as a personal review of Flutter and mobile application development in preparation for my thesis. It helped me revisit and strengthen my understanding of key development concepts and practices.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I was able to:

- **State Management**: Implement efficient state management techniques to handle dynamic data and UI updates.
- **UI/UX Design**: Design an intuitive and visually appealing interface that adapts to user preferences (e.g., dark and light modes).
- **MVVM Architecture**: Utilize the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.
- **Reusable Widgets**: Create and utilize reusable widgets to streamline the development process and improve consistency across the app.
